# Project Instructions: LSDMU Summarization Corpus  
### Bache Archive Project · CC0 1.0 Universal

---

## 🌌 Purpose

This project creates a **complete, section-level abstractive summary dataset** for  
*LSD and the Mind of the Universe* by **Christopher M. Bache, Ph.D. (2019)**.

Each summary expresses the conceptual and spiritual essence of a specific section of the book in approximately 400 words of new, luminous prose.  
The purpose is to preserve and transmit the *meaning* of Bache’s journey—its philosophical depth, psychological precision, and mystical scope—so that future generations of readers and intelligent systems can engage with these ideas while the book’s original text remains under copyright.

The *LSDMU Summarization Corpus* is created as a gift to education, research, and the evolution of human understanding.

## 🧭 Core Principles

1. **Fidelity of Meaning** – Summaries must arise directly from each section’s ideas. No invention or speculation.  
2. **Abstractive Synthesis** – Capture the conceptual whole rather than paraphrasing sentence by sentence.  
3. **Terminology Integrity** – Preserve key terms verbatim (e.g., *Deep Time*, *Diamond Luminosity*, *Species-Mind*).  
4. **Clarity and Concision** – Aim for ~400 words per section; accessible yet precise.  
5. **Transformative Fairness** – All writing is new expression released under CC0 for educational use.  
6. **Respect for Source** – Honor *LSD and the Mind of the Universe* as the origin of inspiration and insight.

## 🧩 Inputs and Outputs

**Input Context**  
The project draws meaning from internally prepared, sectioned readings of the book, following a consistent filename pattern such as:

lsdmu_c05_s03  →  Chapter 5, Section 3
lsdmu_apx01_s01 → Appendix 1, Section 1

**Output Format**  
Each summary is saved as a JSON file following this structure:

```json
{
  "section_file": "lsdmu_c05_s03.md",
  "title": "Deep Time and the Soul",
  "summary": "A 400-word abstractive synthesis capturing the conceptual arc.",
  "keywords": ["deep time", "species-mind", "rebirth", "cosmic evolution"],
  "concept_links": ["future_human", "diamond_luminosity"],
  "model": "gpt-5",
  "words_target": 400
}

A simple registry file (metadata/lsdmu_registry.json) indexes all section metadata for continuity and reference.

🜂 Methodological Notes
	•	Tone: luminous, academic, reverent—reflecting Bache’s own contemplative clarity.
	•	Perspective: descriptive rather than interpretive; faithful to Bache’s worldview.
	•	Consistency: each summary should stand alone yet contribute to a coherent conceptual sequence.
	•	Editorial Discretion: when ambiguity arises, prioritize conceptual accuracy and thematic unity.

  "title": "Expanding the Narrative—Who Is the Patient?",
  "summary": "This section turns from the immediacy of visionary encounter to the fragile scaffolding of theory, not to domesticate the ineffable but to give the experiences room to integrate. The author begins within an individual model of transformation—Grof’s language of ego-death, symptom relief, and the healing of a single life. Yet the post-ego-death deluge of suffering—sustained, excessive, and clearly transpersonal—refuses to be read as leftover personal material. The magnitude itself becomes a teacher, dismantling the presumption that the work serves the solitary self. What first seemed an unfinished purification is recast as a field-event meant for more than one person.  The pivot arrives with a collective model: by weaving Sheldrake’s morphic fields into Grof’s cartography, the author proposes that highly energized psychedelic states can activate collective strata in ways that precipitate a species-level healing process. In this reframing, the “patient” becomes a portion of humanity; the session-holder is the aperture and instrument through which a META-COEX—an aggregate complex of historical anguish—can surface, be metabolized, and release. The dynamics parallel personal therapy: blockages, memory, catharsis, and integration recur, but at a vaster scale. Von Franz’s aphorism confirms the intuition: deep work on the unconscious radiates invisibly into larger psychic units. The ethical tension—between humility and an inflated sense of mission—is resolved not by grandiosity but by fidelity to phenomenology: the individual dissolves into preexisting fields that, for a time, use a person as their working unit.  Finally, the author revises his earlier “two-tiered perinatal” account. Rather than stretching the perinatal lexicon to cover collective ordeal, he adopts a recursive spiral of death and rebirth: an archetypal cycle that repeats as consciousness descends or ascends through deeper registers. Any single death-rebirth may braid multiple levels, but the life-trajectory shows a serial passage—personal, cultural, species—through recurrent crucibles. The spiral image clarifies that ego-death is not a terminal event but a repeating pattern, each loop dissolving a larger identity and inaugurating a wider belonging. The therapy, then, is not only about the person becoming whole; it is about the world healing through the person who can bear it. In the arc of the book, this chapter widens the protagonist of healing from self to species and offers the spiral as the structuring metaphor for what follows.",

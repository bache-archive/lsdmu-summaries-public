  "summary": "An epigraph on the shaman’s vocation frames this chapter as a collective as well as personal awakening: the psyche’s shamanic dimension rises to ferry vision back from the far shore. The author recounts the cost of halting a death–rebirth process midstream: a lingering torsion in the psyche, a year of living “from memory,” and the paradoxical necessity of thickening rather than thinning psychic boundaries. Exercise, food, and ordinary life ballast become spiritual practices; meditation, once spacious, now overexposes him to inner weather. During a six-year hiatus he builds a life—family, publications, academic standing—while continuing to explore adjacent thresholds: Gestalt and somatic therapy, past-life hypnotherapy, Holotropic Breathwork with the Grofs, and Monroe’s Hemi-Sync. Yet the unfinished rite keeps calling. \n\nReentering in 1990, he finds the current waiting where he left it, as if an exacting intelligence had bookmarked the work. The suffering resumes and swells, cresting through seven sessions toward a culmination in session 24. With the deepening of purgation comes a matching deepening of grace: the visionary field shifts from autobiographical condensation to initiations into the architecture and intent of the universe itself. No rationale is offered; the pedagogy is implicit—spiral instruction, thematic recurrence, increasing complexity—until the whole mosaic is legible only at sequence’s end. \n\nThe chapter outlines seven stations—You and I Creating; The Cosmic Tour; The Council of Elders; Dying into Oneness; The Master Plan (22–23); Healing the Collective Wound—largely at the subtle level, with one portal brushing the causal. Session 18, sketched in, opens with transpersonal agony of primordial-to-galactic scope, suffering that exceeds any single biography. From that crucible, patterns simplify into a cosmic yin/yang, a primordial dyad approached and merged with, the universe felt as saturated with maternal presence. The title implies a creative polarity—“you and I” as source and witness, mother and spark—whose co-activity births worlds. The rhythm the author preserves is the chapter’s method: descent as prelude to disclosure, cleansing as aperture for cosmological instruction. \n\nThus the section marks the crossing from individual catharsis into initiatory cosmology, inaugurating the book’s most encompassing phase of education by the universe’s own mind.",

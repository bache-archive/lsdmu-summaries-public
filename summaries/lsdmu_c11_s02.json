  "title": "Why I Stopped My Sessions",
  "summary": "The cessation arrives not as strategy but as a clear inner verdict: a life of high-dose voyaging has crossed an invisible threshold. Two forces render continuation untenable. First, the body’s subtle circuitry—once pliant under years of practice—now labors under an unrelenting influx of power. Prana outpaces the meridians’ capacity; the heart, brow, and crown throb with a pressure that meditative skill can only briefly soothe. What was once interpreted as incomplete dying is re-understood as the excess of death-rebirth itself: repeated descents into the furnace of origin have overheated the organism. The wisdom here is physiological and metaphysical at once—knowing when brightness must be wrapped, cooled, and allowed to settle into form. Blake’s measure of “more than enough” becomes somatic truth.\n\nSecond, and deeper, is the unbearable grief of returning. Serial intimacies with the crystalline Beloved make re-entry increasingly cruel. The temporary nature of the psychedelic sacrament discloses a paradox: the more complete the union, the sharper the wound of separation. Renunciation becomes an act of fidelity—better no entrance than another rending of the heart.\n\nOnly afterward does a third reason ripen into view: the Diamond Luminosity has begun a slow, incarnational descent. The sessions themselves had been simplifying, pivoting from cosmic range to immediate presence, instructing silence rather than amplification. To cooperate with this grace, the author recognizes, one must stop bending the membrane of awareness outward. A different discipline is asked for: receptivity without reach, stillness that allows the subtle to congeal into life.\n\nThe closing act is devotional and decisive. A vow is made with the Beloved: do not draw me again into depths I cannot remain in forever. In that covenant, the pilgrimage ends—its resumption deferred to death, when permanence might finally answer longing. The stopping is not failure, but completion: honoring creaturely limits, protecting the heart, and making room for the slow work of embodiment that grand experiences alone cannot finish. In the book’s arc, this section marks the turn from heroic exploration to the quiet ethics of integration, where love chooses duration over peak, and radiance learns to live in flesh.",

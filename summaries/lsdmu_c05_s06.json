  "title": "Stopping My Sessions",
  "summary": "This section contemplates the asymmetry between the intimate certainties borne of psychedelic practice and the bewilderment of loved ones who must live with its consequences without sharing its inner verification. The narrator acknowledges a paradox at the heart of visionary work: while the traveler learns to trust the process through direct encounter, the partner must trust the traveler, not the visions—a more precarious, relational faith. The portrait of a marriage tested by extreme states is neither accusatory nor romanticized. Instead, it traces the ethical pressure exerted when repeated descents into hell and ascents into heaven outpace the household’s capacity to metabolize them. Without elders, lineages, or community containment, the work risks becoming a solitary experiment in ontological brinkmanship, luminous for the one and destabilizing for the two. \n\nIn Carol’s steadfast refusal to enter the “kiva,” we meet a counterpath: contemplative stillness as complete sufficiency. Her boundary is not a negation of spirit but a different sacrament, insisting that love must be inhabitable, not just visionary. When she asks him to stop, she transforms an invisible metaphysical question into a tangible ethical one: Which vows hold? The author’s decision to cease, guided by the very sessions that had counseled preservation of their union, refigures psychedelics from an engine of expansion into a tutor of restraint. The act of stopping becomes an initiatory gesture in its own right—a disciplined hand on the throttle, converting insight into covenant.\n\nThe text lingers in the residue that follows: hell realms still turning, Deep Time still reverberating through the mind’s corridors. This unfinishedness is crucial. It marks the passage from revelation to integration, from exceptional states to the slow work of fidelity. The marriage becomes the new crucible; the home, the new kiva. The section is thus a study in mature discernment: how to honor vastness without sacrificing the fragile vessel that bears it, how to acknowledge that genuine transformation sometimes requires ending the very means that opened the door.\n\nAs a pivot in the book’s arc, this chapter consolidates earlier visionary expansions into a relational ethic, preparing the ground for a practice in which love, boundaries, and integration become the true vehicles of awakening.",

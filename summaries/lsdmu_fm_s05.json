  "title": "INTRODUCTION: 73 Days",
  "summary": "The author stakes his life’s inquiry on a disciplined wager: that seventy-three carefully structured LSD sessions could function as both microscope and telescope for consciousness. He situates this wager within an older lineage—the human habit of gathering under the night sky with sacred medicines to remember what we are—and contrasts it with a modern prohibition that stripped psychedelics of therapeutic and philosophical dignity. Against that eclipse, he tracks a slow dawn: the 2014 cultural pivot where scientific journals, major universities, and public discourse began to restore research legitimacy, hinting that these substances heal our wounds and illuminate the architecture of reality itself. Trained as a philosopher of religion, he is drawn less to spectacle than to epistemology: can the doors of perception be methodically opened to test questions of meaning, survival, and cosmic intelligence? Reading Stanislav Grof reframes LSD from hallucinogen to instrument; set and setting become an ethics of inquiry, not a circumvention of it. Yet the law transforms philosophy into clandestinity. Keeping faith with his vocation and his community, he divides his life: visible professor, hidden psychonaut; public service above ground, private initiations below. This double fidelity yields two parallel archives—grants, courses, publications on the one hand; seventy-three days of deep interior fieldwork on the other—held apart until retirement loosens the gag order of an era. The introduction therefore does three things at once: it declares the data set (73 sessions over two decades), supplies the historical and institutional atmosphere in which it was gathered, and advances the central claim that psychedelics possess not only therapeutic but philosophical value—the capacity to penetrate the sensory membrane and disclose a wider landscape of mind. As science begins to replace politics and we rejoin our ancestors in contemporary clinics, the author invites readers to treat his sessions as disciplined experiments and as testimonies of participation in a larger, intelligent cosmos. The promise and risk, the secrecy and the care, the ancient memory and modern method—all are braided here as prologue to a rigorous spiritual empiricism. In the book’s arc, this section sets the method, stakes, and context for a memoir of inquiry that argues, through lived evidence, for the reality and relevance of the mind of the universe.",

  "title": "A Flash of “God”",
  "summary": "The chapter announces a new register of cleansing: not the familiar purgations of pain, archetypal fire, or shamanic unmaking, but a radical dispersal into the Many. Beginning in session 32, consciousness fractures into an impenetrable plurality, a chaos without horizon. The author refrains from premature interpretation, affirming a hard-earned epistemic humility: meaning belongs to the next altitude of awareness; while within a level, one must trust the process without seeing its telos. Session 33 reopens in this same darkness. The dissolution here is not dramatic suffering but the loss of cohesion itself—death by diffusion. Where there had been an ordered singularity, only an entropic plural remains. In the nadir of this disorder, a delicate, brilliant rain of white radiance descends. Ecstasy touches confusion; the transition is unstable, but remembrance becomes a subtle technology. By recalling the taste of light, attention entrains to it, and identity shifts: not seeing light but being it—the expanse, depth, and simultaneity that characterize luminosity. The stay is brief yet decisive, a pivot that reconfigures the afternoon. Then the consummating moment: life’s diverse intricacy unfurls as exquisite patterning, and at once collapses—not into annihilation but into seamless unity. The same field discloses itself as One, a lightning-bolt of nonduality so concentrated that it obliterates prior frames. The flash withdraws, leaving reverent wreckage and a new sobriety. In the afterglow, the author recognizes the traditional name for this reality: “God,” not as a distant sovereign but as the immediate unity of all that appears. The confession of naiveté signals an ethical shift: the path ahead cannot be navigated by prior maps. Philosophically, the chapter discloses a law of passage: fragmentation is not a detour but a solvent that unmakes the knower, preparing the organ of recognition for unity. The Many does not precede the One as a rival but as the veil the One wears until attention ripens. Remembrance shows its quiet power; surrender shows its rigorous demand. Theophany arrives as a one-second event with epochal consequence, a seed of understanding that will germinate in subsequent sessions. In the book’s arc, this section marks the hinge from purgative deconstruction to nondual illumination, orienting the journey beyond archetypal depth toward metaphysical simplicity.",

  "summary": "This section names the second ordeal of return: not the loss of communion but the proscription against speaking it. The author accepts secrecy as the cost of unsanctioned inquiry, only to discover its corrosive afterlife—silence that enables revelation also impedes integration, splitting inner truth from public role until the fracture migrates inward. Against this, he invokes older templates: in visionary cultures, one returns to elders to offer the vision for counsel and communal use. Vision is not a private ornament but a message entrusted to a bearer; without a witnessing circle, integration remains partial, the balance between transcendence and immanence destabilized.\n\nThe social nature of integration is emphasized. In a culture naïve or hostile to psychedelics, friendships thin; one can enter others’ worlds while they cannot enter one’s own. Loneliness, Jung’s kind—born from truths that cannot be said—deepens, especially within the university. A born teacher must disown the most philosophically decisive experiences of his life, translating their insights into safe discourse on research, emptiness, and nonduality while refusing the ground from which he speaks. Truth, conveyed obliquely, is diluted; pedagogy loses a vital tether to lived reality. The body registers the contradiction: a throat spasm, a small bark, the vocal trace of an inner injunction—what can be said must not be said—inscribing itself on the nervous system.\n\nYet the narrative refuses victimhood and opens to a karmic horizon. The “sickness” is older than this career: lifetimes of punishment for speaking against orthodoxy, of survival through silence, have left the Soul with a fear-script around voice and truth. In this life, the pattern reprises in new form—a heterodox thinker in a conservative institution, carrying forbidden knowledge into public roles that require concealment. The lesson ripens: integration requires not only psychological processing but consecrated speech within a trustworthy community. Without containers that honor visionary testimony, the knower is estranged from the known, and the voice—organ of belonging—turns against itself. The implicit summons is to restore cultural forms capable of receiving vision without either sensationalizing or pathologizing it.\n\nAs part of the book’s arc, this chapter marks the pivot from solitary revelation to the communal ethics of witnessing, preparing the necessity—and risk—of breaking silence as an act of healing.",

  "title": "Another Voice: Bede Griffiths",
  "summary": "As a coda to the chapter’s panoramic vision, Bede Griffiths enters not as a psychedelic herald but as a contemplative witness whose life braided Christian and Hindu realization. His phrase the hour of God names a kairos in which the stakes are total: humanity’s survival depends on a civilization-wide re-centering in a transcendent awareness that both embraces the whole and exceeds current consciousness. Griffiths refuses euphemism. Our era, he says, is a crucifixion of inherited securities across every domain. The gravity is unsentimental, yet it does not terminate in despair. He frames the passage as a paschal ordeal: to cross into a genuine new age will cost everything, requiring a collective death to the past and to habitual modes of being so that a deeper aliveness can be received by grace. \n\nHe discerns a ruthless contest already unfolding between forces that bind us to the past—religious fundamentalism, nationalism, materialism, corporate greed—and forces arising from a hunger for an altogether new way of living and doing. The theater of struggle is interior as much as institutional, and its decisive instrument is attention: what we consent to center our lives upon. Against nostalgia and nihilism alike, Griffiths testifies to divine help, a showering of protection and guidance for those sincere enough to change and courageous enough to risk transformation. The goal is not triumph but birth: a new world and a new humanity, emerging through the midwifery of sacrifice, clarity, and compassion. \n\nIn this exchange, the contemplative gaze meets historical urgency. Conversion is rendered not as belief revision but as the reconfiguration of consciousness—an integrative theosis in which transcendence and immanence become mutually luminous. Griffiths’s authority issues from a life of intercultural practice; his calm does not soften the severity, it steadies it, inviting a clear-eyed hope that is both demanding and tender.\n\nPlaced here, his voice widens the book’s arc beyond pharmacology toward a convergent testimony from multiple wisdom streams, confirming that the work at hand is a shared death and rebirth through which a future, more compassionate human order can be born.",

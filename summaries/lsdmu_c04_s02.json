  "title": "The Riddle of the Ocean of Suffering",
  "summary": "The author enters a domain of vast human anguish and asks not only what it is, but what mode of self or world is presupposed by encountering it. He discards a reductive psychologism—this is not a disguised inventory of his personal rage nor a karmic ledger demanding repayment—because the phenomenology and intensity exceed any plausible biographical source. Stanislav Grof’s cartography then becomes an initial compass: at the perinatal interface, where personal and transpersonal strata interweave, clusters of collective memory commonly constellate around ego-dissolution. Grof’s COEX systems (emotionally coherent clusters spanning one life) are mirrored, the author proposes, by vaster META-COEX systems—aggregations of humanity’s memories organized by shared affect—operating at the subtle level. Within this frame, the torrents of war, torture, illness, and institutionalized despair that surge through psychedelic sessions are treated as “choral” resonances called to the “lead” aria of ego-death. The author provisionally accepts this dramaturgy. It fits the data, reassures through precedent, and offers a teleology: once the ego’s death-rebirth completes, the chorus will fade. Yet fidelity to experience compels a revision. The signature markers of perinatal process—fetal sensations, somatic discharges, the clenching existential terror characteristic of the birth canal ordeal—subside or vanish. What remains is an unadorned, iterative opening into fields of collective suffering whose scale and integrity resist being reduced to secondary accompaniment. The landscape feels autonomous, not an echo; a world-soul weather system rather than a personal storm attracting debris. This suggests a re-weighting of the ontology: the psyche may not merely resonate with the collective; it may be one node in a meta-organism whose memories self-organize into thematic seas that sometimes flood a person for reasons other than private completion. The author thus stands at a hinge between maps—acknowledging Grof’s invaluable topology while sensing a larger economy of meaning in which the purpose of entering the ocean is not only to cleanse the “I,” but to witness with and as the many. This section reframes the quest from an individual therapeutic crucible to a transpersonal field encounter, preparing the book’s arc to widen from personal death-rebirth to participatory attunement with the world’s pain.",

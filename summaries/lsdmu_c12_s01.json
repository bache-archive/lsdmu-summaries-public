  "summary": "This section traces the unforeseen difficulty of descending from a long initiatory ascent. The author, who meticulously integrated each psychedelic session, discovers that integrating the entire pilgrimage is a second mountain: not merely returning with gifts, but carrying a wound cut by beauty and by years of concealment. As his subtle energy cools over five years, spontaneous synchronicities recede; what once arrived like lightning now asks for consent, finesse, and shared choreography. Yet the more consequential shift is inward: a profound melancholy takes root, a sense of being marooned from the Beloved after having dissolved many times into luminous communion. The familiar mystic night arrives not as punishment but as the afterglow of excess transcendence. He recognizes the pattern in near-death returnees and in Jung’s post-vision gloom: the ache of leaving the crystalline radiance to reinhabit boxes and calendars. The paradox clarifies—one can be wounded by too much of the beyond. It is not too much divinity, since all is God, but too much transcendence at the expense of immanence. An inner teaching names the task: there is a dying of seeing and a dying of keeping. He has completed the former—visionary surrender—and now faces the latter—learning to hold, inhabit, and steward what has been seen without fleeing the world for it. He carries durable fruits from the journey—trust in the soul’s evolution, a felt pulse of the collective heart, the intelligence pervading all things—yet knowledge does not anesthetize longing. Striving for permanent divine awareness exceeds his current capacity; lighter medicines offer temporary bridges but deepen the impatience of coming and going. Finally, he diagnoses the core imbalance: living as one who waits to die is failed integration. In seeking the Great Expanse he inadvertently reenacted the axial mistake, privileging elsewhere over here. The path forward must braid transcendence with embodiment so that the Beloved is not only ascended to but breathed and lived. In the book’s arc, this chapter marks the pivot from heroic ascent to the humbler labor of keeping—translating diamond luminosity into daily fidelity, so the return does not erase the vision but roots it in the world.",

  "summary": "Across seven sessions, the narrator encountered a distilled axis of selfhood, not a map of events but a core orientation—an inner gravity that made the ordinary arrangements of work and relationship gleam with deliberate meaning. This interior compass brought a felt emplacement: the sense of standing in the right field of life, with the right people, at the right time. It also conferred patience—permission to be unfinished, to move with the cadence of unfolding rather than against it, to trust becoming as much as being.\n\nA single interpersonal revelation becomes the hinge: recognizing a difference in soul age between himself and Carol. Treated as a metaphor within a reincarnational horizon, this distinction reframed their asymmetries of sensitivity and contemplative ease. It invited humility rather than hierarchy, and creativity rather than coercion. Instead of forcing convergence or bargaining for a neutral middle that satisfied no one, they began to design a life that could honor two tempos of development. This was not a miraculous cure; it was an attunement, a new ethical style of presence to one another.\n\nThe last sessions counseled fidelity to the marriage precisely when dissolution seemed probable. He chose to remain, to recommit, and to discover what unusual companionship could mean. Years later, after rich shared seasons, they chose to part. Crucially, the earlier guidance is not negated by the later outcome. The truth of guidance is shown to be time-indexed: it asks for fidelity to the deepest truth available in a given hour, not obedience to a fixed prophetic script. Agency and grace meet in the practice of situated discernment.\n\nRooted in Time names the paradox the sessions reveal: to be grounded in purpose is not to be spared change; to be oriented is not to be finished. The self is a tree gaining rings, not a monument. In this sense, the visions do not foretell; they midwife patience, responsibility, and reverence for difference.\n\nAs part of the book’s arc, this section translates transpersonal insight into concrete relational ethics, showing how visionary knowledge can stabilize ordinary time without foreclosing its future.",

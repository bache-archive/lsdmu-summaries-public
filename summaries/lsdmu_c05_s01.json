  "title": "My Life as a Completed Whole",
  "summary": "Set against a season of vocational disillusionment and marital discord, the chapter opens with a quiet confession: the everyday frame was failing to cohere. Into that fracture, a sequence of seven sessions arrives as an organizing intelligence, offering not advice but a new axis of orientation—life apprehended as a completed whole. Session 11, catalyzed by the aftermath of fierce psychic cleansing and the stately surge of Beethoven’s Fifth, widens the aperture from personal time to galactic time. The cosmos appears not as scenery but as pedagogy: spiraled arms of stars disclose the magnitudes by which existence keeps time, and the seer dilates to match them. In this dilation, the ordinary chronology tips on end, revealing a vertical, end-to-end view where past, present, and future condense into a single field. What comes forward is not episodes but essence—the soul beneath the stages—revealed through the constancy of bonds, recurring ideas, and life-tasks that arc across decades like returning comets.\n\nThe knowing that arises is not inferential but orchestral: textures from disparate eras sound together in a symphony of simultaneity. Detail saturates without overwhelm because it is patterned; the experience is less seeing than being tuned to a field where all the evidence is present at once. From this vantage, the future is not predicted but tasted. One inhabits the older self, feeling its distilled grain, sensing the residue of a life’s choices as a palpable now. Relationships, too, are beheld in their totality—shared histories grasped as one movement rather than a sequence of notes—yielding an objective compassion for what has been and what is still ripening.\n\nAcross ensuing sessions the vision proves stable and educable, repeating with variation as if to inscribe its teaching. The author places this in a lineage by invoking Jung’s post-infarction ecstasy of non-temporal unity, affirming that such dilation is not an idiosyncrasy but a recurrent contour of human consciousness when time loosens. In sum, the chapter transposes crisis into a larger key: biography is scored within cosmology, and the self is recognized as a coherent theme woven through changing tempos of life. As part of the book’s arc, this section marks the pivot from purgative unbinding to integrative sight, establishing deep time as the stage upon which subsequent insights will be set.",

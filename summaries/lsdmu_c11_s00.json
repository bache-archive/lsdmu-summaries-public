  "title": "Final Vision",
  "summary": "An elder cadence opens this closing movement: the storms of vision no longer controlled by intention but received from a larger intelligence that has always held the reins. Nearing fifty, the narrator names the cost—years of work for rare hours of communion—and the grace: the same intelligence that led the way now choreographs an ending. The chapter frames three late sessions, with the last two as farewell; but before parting there is a final, exacting purification.\n\nSession 70 enters the crucible without ornament. Identity is dismantled layer by layer—sometimes like the easing off of skin, sometimes like bark torn from a sapling. The practitioner’s discipline is surrender, the recurrent loosening of whatever clutches, until surrender itself is pressed past familiar thresholds. Fear rises not as an ego’s panic—ego is already in fragments—but as a more primal protest. Meeting it with lucid consent, he discovers fear as a boundary membrane: once passed, it dissolves and the stripping intensifies. Reality—not merely biography—calves like a glacier, great shelves of world-assumption shearing away. Frames of reference collapse in waves, leaving a coherent core that chooses only to keep falling. At last, exhausted closure: not a triumphant breakthrough, but the felt completion that follows a deep cleanse.\n\nWhat opens is ordinary and numinous at once: the physical room coincides with an inner forest, sun-streaked and wind-stirred, two orders of reality interpenetrating without friction. Then form turns fluid; time loosens its bridle. Months, years, generations accelerate, revealing the world as a single throbbing organism throwing up beings like waves that crest, break, and are reabsorbed. The vision is devastating and consoling—birth, life, and death seen as continuous respiration of the Totality, reincarnation as the surf of Being. Not symbol, not fancy, but a deeper mode of knowing time. The session’s severity now reads as preparation: only after the great shearing could the seer abide the sight of cycles so vast that personal meaning both shatters and ripens. Diamonds are costly—yet here they refract the oceanic pulse into human comprehension.\n\nThis section turns the book toward culmination, fusing ordeal and insight to announce the closing arc in which surrender ripens into instruction and farewell.",
